I know what you're thinking... Why? Why would ANYONE make this?? WELL I'LL TELL YOU WHY!!!! 


>John F. Kennedy once said:
`
“We choose to go to the moon not because it's easy, but because it's hard; because that goal will serve to organize and measure the best of our energies and skills, because that challenge is one that we are willing to accept, one we are unwilling to postpone, and one which we intend to win.”
`

Now that has nothing to do with this at all, just added that in for dramatic effect. Truthfully, this came out of an absolutely ridicuous joke between some friends, and I had nothing better to do on a Friday night than make this a thing. So HERE YOU GO.
